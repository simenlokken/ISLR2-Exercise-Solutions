# ISLR2-Exercise-Solutions
Solutions for the exercises related to the ISLR2 book. Most likely, I will not do all exercises and there will guaranteed be some mistakes here, so feel free to comment.

ISLR mostly uses base R for analysis. My solutions will be oriented around Tidyverse and that environment.
